# CSS Exercise 13: Generated content, counters, and lists

## Pseudo-elements

Sometimes we don't have an appropriate element, or child elements to work with. We could use *pseudo-elements* instead!

But for a pseudo-element to work we need a special property set for the elementâ€¦

- Do you know what that special property is?
- What *functions* can we use in that property's value?
- What are the various pseudo-elements?
- Why would we use pseudo-elements?

## Counters

Some generated content can include counters.

- How do we *count* in CSS - i.e. what declaration do we use?
- How do we reset a counter?
- What are counters useful for?

## Lists

There are some specific properties and values tied to Lists, i.e. `<ul>`, `<ol>` and their `<li>`.

- Name as many properties as you can that are only related to lists
- What types of bullet styles are there?
- Can any group of elements be styled to look like a list?
