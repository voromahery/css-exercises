# CSS exercise 21: Positioning

Today we're going to be working with the `position` property, and its values:

- `relative`
- `absolute`
- `fixed`
- `sticky`

Positioning is a layout-breaking form of layout. i.e. it pulls elements out of the normal flow, and one has to use known dimensions to account for these positioned elements.

First up though, what is the default value for `position`?

Try answer these questions too:

- What are some of the other properties you need to supply when using any non-default position value?
- What is the inferred `display` value of an element that has been *positioned*?
- One of the non-default values for `position` still maintains a box in the flow of the document. Which one is it?
- What is special or significant about `fixed` and `sticky` positioning?
- When positioning an element *absolutely*, how can we lock that element's coordinates to its parent element?
- What are `absolute` positioned layouts useful for?
- Sometimes if you put two absolutely positioned elements in the same physical space, they'll stack, i.e. only one will be visible on top. What are the rules here? Why is a certain element on top? How can we adjust that ourselves?
- What is CSS's 'Stacking Context'?
