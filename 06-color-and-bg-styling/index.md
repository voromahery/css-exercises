# CSS exercise 06: Mixing colours and backgrounds

By now you should have realised that colours can be solid (i.e. not see-through), or various levels of transparent (you can see through them).

In this exercise we'll start mixing HTML images (which have transparent parts to them) and CSS `background-color`s, gradient `background-images`, and multiple backgrounds.

## Exercise details

Feel free to change any HTML you need, including adding elements that you can then style later. Try not to add `<img>` elements, we're going to use the CSS for that. So, check out the `images` folder, and usethose images for the three scenes we have set up, one for each character.

Put your CSS changes in `css/mixing.css`.

You're going to need to use:

- `background-color`
- `background-image` using files
- `background-image` using gradients
- multiple `background-image`s
- `background-position`
- `background-repeat`
- `background-size`
