# CSS exercise 18: Overflow & Clipping

In this exercise we're going to isolate parts of images, and text, as well as manage the overflow of content that is too big for its container.

Have a look at `overflow.html`. You'll see instructions inside each section. Put your changes in `css/overflow.css`.

You should be using the following properties:

- `overflow`
- `clip-path`
- `text-overflow`

Good luck!
