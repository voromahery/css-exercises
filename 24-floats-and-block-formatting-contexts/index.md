# CSS exercise 24: Floats and block formatting contexts

Time to learn about floats, flow, and formatting contexts.

## Floats

We need to know the following properties:

- `float`
- `clear`

1. What are their default values?
1. What are the possible values for `clear`?
1. What is the rule associated with a floated item in terms of source order?
1. Can you float other elements besides images?
1. Is there a way to create a two-column layout with floats?

## BFC (Block formatting context)

1. Describe in your own words what BFC is all about.
1. We can 'clear' a float by creating a block formatting context on the parent, this is achieved by putting a certain set of properties on the container. What are those properties?
1. Will you forget about Block Formatting Contexts tomorrow? :P
