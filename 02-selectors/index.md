# CSS exercise 02: Selectors

In the accompanying stylesheet, you'll find some comments attached to a number of rulesets that are missing proper selectors.

Apply the correct selector to each ruleset, given the comment above it.

We'll be using the following selectors:

- Element selector
- Class selector
- ID selector
- Some pseudo-class selectors
- Child combinator
- Descendent combinator
- Adjacent sibling combinator
- General sibling combinator
- Attribute selectors

â€¦ and any combination thereof. Can you name which selector type you used for each example?
