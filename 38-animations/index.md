# CSS exercise 38: Keyframe animations

You've asked for looping and infinite animationsâ€¦ that's what Keyframe Animations are for!

No need for a higher-specificity selector to drive them too, you can set animations on the base styles of any element.

Let's do some research:

1. Keyframe Animation setup needs some unique code, what does it start with?
1. What makes the keyframes code different to the rest of CSS?
1. How do we use a keyframe animation we set up earlier as a property in a ruleset for an element?
1. Keyframe animations have other keywords that aren't available in `transitions`, what are these keywords?
1. How many properties can we animate at once?
1. What properties are animatable?
