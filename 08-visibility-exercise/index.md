# CSS exercise 08: Visibility exercise

Let's take what we've learned with `opacity`, `display: none;` and `visibility` and apply it to this exercise.

Each section will require the strict use of a property or two at a time. Read the instructions in each section's header, and apply your changes to `visibility.css`.
