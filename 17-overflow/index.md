# CSS exercise 17: Overflow and clipping

Overflow in CSS refers to the way the contents of a box are handled if they don't fit within that box.
In other words, when a width restraint is placed on a box, how should the text and other content within that box behave?

Have a look at the followig properties:

- `overflow`
- `clip`
- `clip-path`
- `text-overflow: ellipsis`

For each of these…

- What are their default values?
- Why would we use these properties? What makes them useful?
- What other properties need to be set before these properties can work effectively?

And more general questions…

- What is the browser's default way to handle contents that are larger than its container?
- What is an Ellipsis? How is that different from an Ellipse?
- How is `text-overflow` different from the other properties?
