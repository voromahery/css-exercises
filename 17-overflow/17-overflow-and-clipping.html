      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <dfn>Overflow</dfn> in <abbr title="cascade-style-sheet">CSS</abbr> refers to the way the contents of a box are
        handled if they don't fit within that
        box.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a width restraint is placed on a box, the part of the text and other content within that box will go out of
        the box.
      </p>

      <h2>Properties</h2>
      <code>overflow: visible</code>
      <p>
        It helps to manage the content in a box if the content is too big for the box so that it can fit properly in a
        box. It helps to control the layout.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make it work, we need <code>border</code>.
      </p>
      <code>clip: auto</code>
      <p>
        It controls what part of a content is visible. It can also help to position an element.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make it work, we need <code>border</code>.
      </p>
      <code>clip-path: auto</code>
      <p>
        It creates clipping region that sets what part of an element should be shown. It allows us to make complex
        shape by clipping an element into a basic shape (circle, polygon, ellipse...).
      </p>
      <p>
        To make it work, we need <code>clip-path</code>.
      </p>
      <code>text-overflow: ellipsis</code>
      <p>
        It decreases the amount of text displayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make it work, we need <code>padding</code> and <code>border</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The browser's default way to handle contents that larger than its container is a <b>overflow-container</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Ellipsis</b> displays ellipsis to present clipped text. However, <b>ellipse</b> is a way to clip a content to make it circular.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>text-overflow</code> is different from other properties because it only affects content that is
        overflowing a block container element in its inline progression direction.
