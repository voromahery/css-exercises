# CSS exercise 23: Absolute positioning

Let's take what we've learned with `position: absolute;` and use it in a practical exercise.

In `absolute.html` you'll see a number of shapes, and an example or target image.
Try arrange the SVG shapes within `<div class="container">` so that they resemble the target image.

You'll need to use:

- `position`
- `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`
- `width` and `height`
- `overflow`
- and `z-index`

Good luck!
