# CSS exercise 11: Inheritance

Let's do some research on what we commonly refer to as *inheritance* in CSS.

Try to answer the following questions:

- What do we mean by *CSS inheritance*? What does it affect?
- Which properties have values that are inherited by default?
- What is the difference between the `currentColor` and `inherit` keywords when used with colour values?
- What do the `revert`, `initial`, and `unset` keyword values do?
- Are there any dangers or unintended side-effects when using `inherit` as a value? What about the `revert`, `initial` and `unset` properties?
- What are the possibilities with using an ancestor or universal selector, combined with the `inherit` value?
