# CSS exercise 32: The Calc function

This function saved a lot of headaches when it came out. It makes arithmetic easy, and reproducible, but where it really shines is in mixing units.

Here are some questions you should try answer through your research:

1. What values can a `calc()` function support?
1. How can we control the mathematical order of operation (PEDMAS / BODMAS) in the function, so that something like `calc(2 + 3 * 4)` doesn't equal `20`, when it is instead meant to equal `14`?
1. Can we use a `calc()` function to convert one type of unit to another type of unit?
1. If we want to convert a unitless number to a unit value, what do we have to do?
1. Why do the *plus* and *minus* operators inside the function need spaces around them?
1. How can we convert a value into a negative value?
1. Can the `calc()` function work with colour values? e.g. a light red plus a light red should equal a darker red.
