# CSS exercise 15: Table styling

There are a number of unique properties associated with tables:

- `table-layout`
- `border-spacing`
- `border-collapse`
- `caption-side`
- `empty-cells`

Do some research on each property. What are their default values?

## Simulating HTML tables

There are a number of ways to simulate an HTML table in terms of layout.

Take a look at the following `display` values:

- `table`
- `table-row-group`
- `table-header-group`
- `table-footer-group`
- `table-row`
- `table-cell`
- `table-column-group`
- `table-column`
- `table-caption`

What HTML elements do these values correspond to?

## Further research

See if you can answer the following questions:

- What other declaration does `border-spacing` require before it can work effectively?
- What are the downsides of using the various `table*` values for `display` on a set of elements, thereby simulating a table layout on non-table elements?
- What is the difference between `table-layout: fixed` and `table-layout: auto`?
- Can you use `border-spacing` and other table-like properties on non-table elements?
- What other declaration does `empty-cells` require before it can work effectively?
