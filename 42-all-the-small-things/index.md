# CSS exercise 42: All the small things

We haven't covered a number of topics that are really good to know, but each one of them probably didn't deserve their own exercise.

So, let's go through as many of the more important but small properties here as we can:

- `cursor`
- `pointer-events`
- `outline`
- `filter`
- `appearance`
- `object-fit`
- `scroll-snap-align`

There are many more! See [the official list of all CSS properties](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/all-properties.en.html)

Similarly, there are a few pseudo-class selectors we should talk about:

- `:focus`
- `:focus-within`
- `:visited`
- `:active`
- `:target`
- `:disabled`
- `:empty`
- `:not()`
- `:matches()`

And a pseudo-element:

- `::first-letter`

Then, there's the mysterious block:

- `@supports`

And lastly, an interesting pseudo-element value function that has a promising future:

- `attr()`
