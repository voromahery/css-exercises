    <section>
      <h3>When these terms and conditions apply and who is responsible under them</h3>

      <h4>When they start to apply:</h4>

      <p>These terms and conditions start applying to you when you ask us to start supplying electricity to any property
        (an address which we supply electricity to, including land and buildings there) and we agree to supply
        electricity to you. If you ask us to supply electricity to more than one property and we agree to, these terms and conditions
        will apply to all those properties until we stop supplying electricity to them.</p>

      <h4>Moving into a property we already supply:</h4>

      <p>If you move into a property at which we are already supplying electricity and we have not agreed to supply
        electricity to you at that property before you move in:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>you will be required to pay for the electricity you use at that property from the time you move in;</li>
        <li>these terms and conditions apply from the date you moved into the property; and</li>
        <li>you will supply us with evidence to show the date you moved into the property.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Authorised people on your account:</h4>

      <p>You can have someone else be an authorised person in relation to a property. This means that that authorised
        person can operate your account for that property with us and instruct us as if they were you. You are
        responsible
        for all actions of each authorised person.</p>

      <h4>Responsibilities of all people named on your account:</h4>

      <p>If more than one person is named as the customer on an account, each of those people are individually
        responsible
        to us under these terms and conditions. This means that we can require any of these people to meet all of the
        obligations under these terms and conditions, including the payment of all our charges for all properties on the
        account. Every person who wants to be named as a customer on an account needs to gives us their consent.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>We will supply electricity to you and fix issues that occur</h3>

      <h4>We will:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Supply electricity: supply electricity to you in accordance with these terms and conditions;</li>
        <li>Be available: provide you with as much online and telephone help as we reasonably can;</li>
        <li>Resolve problems: run a 24/7 fault service to respond to problems with supply of electricity to your
          property
          or properties.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Using some third parties (identified below) we will also:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Get the electricity to your property: supply electricity to your property through the power lines on your
          electricity network. We arrange this with the network company relevant to your property. If you have a
          contract
          with the network company directly, this will be arranged by them and we won’t do it for you;</li>
        <li>Work out how much electricity you use: measure the electricity that we supply to you. This involves us
          arranging for a provider of metering equipment to ensure a meter is installed at each property so that it can
          measure your consumption and remotely communicate this back to us.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>How electricity is supplied to you:</h4>

      <p>Each property will have a point of connection to the power lines. For most residential properties, this point
        of
        connection will be on a power pole outside the boundary of your property. You can get the exact location
        confirmed
        by your network company.</p>

      <h4>Stay safe:</h4>

      <p><b>All parts of the electricity supply system, including the lines and wires on your property, should be
          treated
          as live at all times. Stay safe around them.</b></p>

      <h4>Sometimes we are not able to meet our obligations to you:</h4>

      <p>We are not required to carry out our responsibilities if an event has occurred which is beyond our reasonable
        control and which prevents or delays us from carrying out those responsibilities. Some examples are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>our website or app is unavailable;</li>
        <li>our arrangements with an electricity metering provider have been suspended or ended;</li>
        <li>our arrangements with a network company have been suspended or ended;</li>
        <li>or a network company cannot supply electricity to a property. We will continue to perform our
          responsibilities
          that are not affected by the event and we will do everything we reasonably can to make sure your electricity
          supply is returned to normal as soon as is reasonably practicable. We are not responsible for any damage that
          results from electricity supply fluctuations.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Issues with our supply of electricity to you</h3>

      <h4>Fixing problems with the supply of electricity:</h4>

      <p>The electricity supply system is complex and sometimes parts of it may not function as they are supposed to,
        for
        example if there is a storm or an accident, or if the supply needs to be urgently cut off for safety reasons.
        When
        this happens, the supply of electricity to you may be interrupted or otherwise affected. Using third parties, we
        will do our best to make sure that the supply of electricity to your property is fixed as soon as we can in the
        circumstances. We will continue to perform our responsibilities that are not affected by these events and we
        will
        do everything we reasonably can to make sure your electricity supply is returned to normal as soon as is
        reasonably practicable. We are not responsible for any damage that results from electricity supply fluctuations.
      </p>

      <h4>Work by network companies may affect supply of electricity:</h4>

      <p>Sometimes network companies need to do work on their networks and this may have an effect on the supply of
        electricity to you. When they do this they usually give at least 4 working days’ notice. Sometimes they have to
        do
        urgent work and will give as much notice as they can. If they do not notify you directly, we will give you as
        much
        notice as we reasonably can and it will generally be about the same as the notice they give us.</p>

      <h4>We recommend you protect your property and appliances:</h4>

      <p>Installing surge protection can protect your appliances from fluctuations in frequency, voltage and problems
        with
        the electricity we supply.</p>

      <h4>We recommend you have insurance:</h4>

      <p>We recommend you have insurance for damage that may result from fluctuations in frequency, voltage and problems
        with the electricity we supply.</p>

      <h4>Who to contact:</h4>

      <p>When there is a problem, or you think that there might be one, with our supply of electricity to you, you
        should
        call us on 0800 123 456. This service is available on a 24-hour basis and is free to call from your cell phone.
        We
        will regularly update information about a supply interruption, in accordance with good industry practice in New
        Zealand. You can also find out about supply interruptions directly from your network company.</p>

      <h4>Let us know if you have special circumstances we should know about. You need to keep us informed. Tell us if:
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>You rely on medical equipment: you or someone else who lives at the property has critical medical support
          that
          relies on the supply of electricity to keep it operating properly; or </li>
        <li>Your health is at risk: there is a real and genuine threat to your health or wellbeing (or someone else who
          lives at the property) because of health, age or disability; or </li>
        <li>Your financial circumstances change: you experience temporary or permanent financial hardship that makes it
          genuinely hard for you or someone else who lives at the property to pay for the electricity we supply to your
          properties.</li>
      </ol>

    <section>
      <h3>Working out how much electricity we supply to you</h3>

      <h4>Smart meter installation:</h4>

      <p>In order to supply your property we need to ensure there is a smart meter at your property. It may be that we
        can
        arrange for a smart meter to be installed at your property. If this is possible we will supply you with a copy
        of
        our Smart Meter Upgrade Terms and Conditions.</p>

      <h4>Meter reading and estimates:</h4>

      <p>We will work out how much electricity we supply to your property by remotely reading the meter on a regular
        basis
        or, if we have not read the meter, are unable to read the meter for any reason, or some or all usage data is
        missing from our attempts to read the meter, we may estimate the amount of electricity supplied to that
        property.
        We may also send out a meter reader to physically read your meter. If we need to estimate any usage data we will
        do so in accordance with clause 5.6. Alternatively, you can call us for a simple explanation as to how we have
        calculated the estimated supply.</p>

      <h4>No unmetered supply:</h4>

      <p>Due to the nature of our business, we are unable to supply electricity to you as a customer if you have or come
        to have any unmetered supply connected to your property. Should you already be a customer of ours and you
        introduce an unmetered supply to your property, or are found to have unmetered supply to your property, you will
        be immediately required to choose another retailer to supply you with electricity in accordance with clause 4.7,
        and our contract with you in respect of that unmetered supply will be at an end.</p>

      <h4>Problems with your measured supply:</h4>

      <p>If you think that the meter is not correctly recording the amount of electricity that you are supplied, you
        need
        to tell us. If you ask us to test a meter, or if we decide to test it, and we find it is not within the industry
        standards of accuracy, we will work out what your actual electricity usage should have been, and we will debit
        or
        credit your account accordingly. If you ask us to test a meter, and it is found to be accurate, we may charge
        you
        for that meter test.</p>

      <h4>Remote communication problems with your meter(s):</h4>

      <p>Your smart meter is designed to remotely communicate your half-hour consumption information to us. This
        half-hour
        consumption information is crucial to our ability to service you as our customer due to the nature of our
        business. In order to remotely communicate, your meter requires sufficient cellular signal strength so it can
        connect to the central database. Should your meter have or come to have insufficient signal strength that does
        not
        resolve itself within 5 calendar days:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>We will initiate an investigation and contact you to discuss possible causes;</li>
        <li>It’s possible that a site visit may be required to determine the cause of the communication issue. If this
          site visit reasonably determines you have knowingly contributed in any way to the reduction in signal strength
          (usually due to new construction on your property, but includes any tampering with the meter or its ability to
          communicate) then you will be charged for this site visit, and any subsequent visits required to attempt to
          resolve this issue in accordance with clause 8;</li>
        <li>Any site visit does not guarantee resolution, and if we are unable to reasonably resolve this communication
          issue we will be unable to continue to service you as a customer. This means you will be required to switch to
          another retailer to supply you with electricity in accordance with clause 4.7;</li>
        <li>If you were to initiate a switch to another retailer, this will not absolve you of your responsibilities
          under
          clause 8 should you be found to have contributed to the failure of your meter’s ability to remotely
          communicate.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Metering standards:</h4>

      <p>All meter readings, tests and associated processes will be done in accordance with relevant New Zealand
        industry
        protocols and codes of practice.</p>

      <h4>When we are unable to continue to provide you with our service:</h4>

      <p>We may require you to find another retailer to supply you with electricity in accordance with clause 4.3 and/or
        clause 4.5. If this is required, we will first attempt to switch you back to the previous retailer that supplied
        your property. If this is not possible, then you must choose another retailer and initiate a switch to them
        within
        3 business days of us notifying you.</p>

      <h3>Paying for the electricity we supply you</h3>

      <h4>You are responsible for paying:</h4>

      <p>You must pay for all of the electricity we supply to each property, including where some or all of that is
        estimated by us. It is your responsibility to pay for all of the electricity supplied to your property from the
        date you moved into the property, including the cost of delivering that electricity to your property. If you
        have
        opted to pay us by credit or debit card you will incur a surcharge of 1% on your total electricity bill, which
        will be clearly detailed on your invoice. The 1% surcharge is incurred when each invoice is generated. You may
        also be responsible for paying other charges as set out in clause 6.8.</p>

      <h4>Do not damage metering equipment:</h4>

      <p>Be careful not to damage any of the metering and other equipment on the property because you may also be
        responsible for paying to fix any such damage.</p>

      <h4>When invoices are issued and when you need to make payment:</h4>

      <p>When we have determined the amount of electricity supplied to a property in accordance with clause 4, we will
        calculate your daily cost. We will do this every day, so you can track your electricity expenditure. We issue
        invoices covering your electricity expenditure for the prior billing period. You will be notified on your
        invoice
        of the payment due date, which will be no less than 2 working days following the date of your invoice. Your
        nominated bank account or credit or debit card will be debited on this payment due date.</p>

      <h4>What happens if you do not pay us:</h4>

      <p>If you do not pay us for any amount you are responsible for and which is due under these terms and conditions,
        or
        if payment from the bank account you have authorised us to direct debit money from or the credit or debit card
        you
        have authorised us to charge is dishonoured, cancelled or refused, we can:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Attempt again to debit your nominated bank account or credit or debit card (we will give you at least 24
          hours’ notice);</li>
        <li>charge you our reasonable costs or fees in collecting money you owe us, including bank fees, credit agency
          fees, legal and court fees;</li>
        <li>Start our debt process, which may in some circumstances lead to disconnection of the electricity supply to
          any
          property supplied under these terms and conditions. If your supply is disconnected, you may be charged fees.
          These will be notified to you before your electricity supply is disconnected.</li>
        <li>If you have been in our debt process, and you switch to another retailer or have your supply disconnected,
          we
          may not be able to take you on as a customer again. If we do allow you to open another account, and you again
          fail to pay us for an amount you owe us under these terms and conditions, we may require you to switch to
          another retailer.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Terms of payment:</h4>

      <p>You need to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>always pay us in full (that means that you cannot deduct amounts from the amount you owe us);</li>
        <li>authorise us to direct debit money from a specific bank account or charge money to a specific credit or
          debit
          card for amounts you owe us;</li>
        <li>ensure that the bank account you have authorised us to direct debit money from or the credit or debit card
          you
          have authorised us to charge is up to date and that it has sufficient clear and accessible funds to cover all
          payments to us at the time for payment, otherwise the provisions in clause 5.4 may apply.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>How estimates work and what you will be charged:</h4>

      <p>If:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>the meter at a property has incorrectly measured the amount of electricity used; or </li>
        <li>the meter reading cannot be taken; or </li>
        <li>we cannot access a meter (including remotely) for a long period of time even though you met your access
          obligations under clause 7; or </li>
        <li>we do not have complete or correct records of your electricity usage or any other components used to
          calculate
          your charges available at the time, </li>
      </ol>

      <p>then we will estimate what the actual electricity usage at the property should have been by building a profile
        of
        your usage based on either; the up to the last 4 weeks of data or on an average user profile. We will then
        charge
        the estimated usage based on the pricing product that you have selected when you join Company X; or, if we are
        unable to automatically estimate your usage, then we may apply an average user profile and use our product to
        calculate your bill.</p>

      <p>Where possible, any estimated usage data, including usage information you have provided to us, will be updated
        with actual usage data, or if we cannot retrieve actual data, finalised estimate data will then be treated as if
        it were actual data. Where we can, and if it is required, we will then either credit or debit your account for
        any
        differences in calculated charges. We will act reasonably and will take into account whether either of us
        contributed to the error or could reasonably have been expected to know of it. In the event we cannot provide
        you
        with an invoice for over 2 months we will work with you to arrange for you to pay that amount over the following
        2
        months.</p>

      <h4>What to do if you think our invoice or our estimate is wrong:</h4>

      <p>If you want to dispute an invoice or the calculations in clause 5.6:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>you should raise your dispute with us in writing prior to the date your next invoice falls due for payment.
          If
          necessary, we will hold the disputed amount separately; or </li>
        <li>if you do not raise a dispute with us prior to the date your next invoice falls due for payment, then we
          will
          deduct the calculated charge for this electricity from your specified bank account or charge your authorised
          credit or debit card.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Checking your usage on your online account:</h4>

      <p>The online account on our website will have a statement showing your electricity usage, costs and any other
        fees
        and charges together with invoices for them.</p>

      <h4>We might ask you for a bond:</h4>

      <p>We may require a bond from you before we can supply or continue to supply electricity to your property or
        properties. This bond is used to provide a level of security in case you default on your account. If we require
        you to comply with this clause, you must do so.</p>

      <h4>The terms of any bond:</h4>

      <p>If we exercise clause 5.9, we will tell you why we need to, how much we require, when it must be paid to us,
        how
        long we will keep it, how we will repay it and other relevant information. The amount of that bond will comply
        with any accepted industry standard or protocol. We do not pay interest on bonds.</p>

      <h4>Credit balances on your account:</h4>

      <p>In the event you have a credit balance on your account, it may only be used to pay for electricity supplied by
        us. In some instances, we may be able to refund credit balances to you, but this may not always be possible, for
        example, if the credit balance is a result of promotional credits received.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Our pricing and other amounts we may need to charge you</h3>

      <h4>Your electricity pricing at your property:</h4>

      <p>Pricing for the electricity we supply may be different for each property supplied by us. The reason for this is
        that there are pricing variations (including, for example, the metering set up, or the time of day that
        electricity is used) that will apply to each property.</p>

      <h4>Changing your pricing plan:</h4>

      <p>If you ask us to change your plan, for example if you want to change your pricing option, your metering set up,
        or if you need to change between low and standard user plans, then we will make such change if we are able.
        Usually these changes will be made with 15 working days unless otherwise specified or unless we notify you of a
        specific reason why it is taking longer. In some cases, there may be fees associated with this, which will be
        notified to you.</p>

      <h4>Rate eligibility:</h4>

      <p>If you stop being eligible for the rate you are on because it is discovered that you no longer meet the
        criteria
        for that rate, we may require you to change to an alternative rate and if we do we will give you 30 days’ notice
        in writing in advance. If it is discovered that you are not eligible for a rate because you provided us with
        inaccurate information when you signed up with us, we may, change the pricing plan you are on to a plan you are
        eligible for (taking into account the revised information) without notice.</p>

      <h4>How your electricity pricing is calculated:</h4>

      <p>Your bill is determined by the total of:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>the generation component, which may be the wholesale cost of electricity for the respective half hour time
          period (also known as the “spot price”), or a set rate that we have agreed with you; and </li>
        <li>the cost of transmitting and distributing electricity from the point of generation to your particular
          property
          during that respective time period and the associated charges of the party(ies) responsible for that
          transmission and distribution; and </li>
        <li>a pro-rated portion of the total monthly cost of the meter lease and metering services for the electricity
          meter(s) on your property provided by the meter owner (the meter tracks your usage against all time periods);
          and</li>
        <li>the Electricity Authority levies and other mandatory industry levies, charges, taxes or fees of any nature;
          and </li>
        <li>our retail charge (“Company X charges”), which we use to service you as our customer.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Some products you may elect may also carry additional costs. These will be detailed on our website.</p>

      <p>Details of each bill will be available in your customer dashboard on our website and on the App.</p>

      <h4>There will be variations in the pricing of electricity supplied:</h4>

      <p>In addition to changes throughout the day (every half hour) for the spot price of generation, your prices may
        also change over the course of a year. Prices for transmission, distribution and metering tend to be reviewed by
        the respective suppliers annually, but can sometimes change more regularly than that, along with Electricity
        Authority levies and other charges described in 6.2.d. We will give you 30 days’ notice of price changes for the
        various components referred to in 6.2 above, with the exception of the spot price which will be priced as per
        the
        market with no notice and where we are given shorter periods of notice by the respective suppliers.</p>

      <h4>Sometimes half-hour prices you are charged are not final:</h4>

      <p>In some exceptional circumstances, the wholesale cost of energy for a half-hour time period(s) may not be
        finalised before your invoice is due to be generated. In this instance, you will be charged what the wholesale
        market refers to as the “interim price” for energy supplied to you during the respective half-hour time periods.
        If your invoice contains charges that are calculated using interim prices we will notify you by email. In almost
        all cases interim prices should be finalised prior to your next invoice. Once finalised, should the final price
        vary from the interim price, we will either credit or debit your account for any differences in calculated
        charges.</p>

      <h4>Pricing will have GST added:</h4>

      <p>Unless otherwise stated, prices exclude GST and GST (if any) will be charged in addition to those GST exclusive
        prices.</p>

      <h4>Other charges required for the supply of electricity to you:</h4>

      <p>We may also charge you for other products or services you require in relation to the supply of electricity to
        your property (such as remote reconnections or testing metering equipment). There may be additional fees for
        these
        types of products and services. If you ask us to provide a product or service that involves an additional cost,
        or
        if you incur a fee or cost under these terms and conditions, we will tell you the total amount you will need to
        pay and whether there are ways you can avoid that fee or cost. In some cases the costs are specific to a
        property
        (such as decommissioning the electricity from a property). In these instances we will provide you with an
        estimate
        of the cost. These costs will appear as a separate line item on your invoice.<br> We may also need to charge you
        certain credit fees as set out under clause 5.4.</p>

      <h4>Recovering those fees from you:</h4>

      <p>Provided we have given you notice, we may deduct any money you owe under these terms and conditions from the
        bank
        account you have authorised us to direct debit money from or the credit or debit card you have authorised us to
        charge.</p>

      <h3>Access to each property</h3>

      <h4>Safe and clear access:</h4>

      <p>For safety and security of supply and other reasons, we and others involved in the supply of electricity to the
        property need clear and safe access to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>each property and any land over which you have an easement or right to pass electricity;</li>
        <li>all metering equipment; and </li>
        <li>any equipment used to supply electricity.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Some of your specific responsibilities:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Restoring supply following an interruption: It is very important that you provide us, the network company
          and
          meter owner (and any agent or subcontractor of any of us) with access any time to restore electricity during
          an
          interruption in your area, to ensure safety, or to protect people or property;</li>
        <li>
          Maintenance and compliance: during business hours, you must allow us, the network company and meter owner (and
          any agent or subcontractor of any of us) access to each property (including to meters and other equipment that
          may be inside) to:
          <ol>
            <li>connect, suspend or disconnect your electricity supply;</li>
            <li>read meters;</li>
            <li>ensure that trees, vegetation, buildings and other obstacles are clear of electricity lines or
              electrical
              equipment and meters. If
              you do not keep them clear you may be charged for the cost of clearing the trees, vegetation or obstacles
              if
              we
              reasonably determine it is required;</li>
            <li>install, inspect, work on or remove any equipment necessary to
              provide electricity;</li>
            <li>investigate or repair any damage or interference or suspected damage or interference
              with the distribution or any equipment used to supply electricity.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Installing load control equipment:</h4>

      <p>You must also allow clear and safe access to a property if we or a network company or meter owner need to
        install
        or maintain equipment for load control.</p>

      <h4>Notice we’ll give you before accessing the property:</h4>

      <p>Except in an emergency situation or where access is routine (for example, inspecting a meter on the outside of
        a
        building), where access is required by a third party, we will give you written notice of when and why access to
        a
        property is required. That notice will be at least 10 business days prior to access if it is for construction,
        upgrade, repair or maintenance; and a reasonable timeframe if access is to inspect or operate any equipment used
        in connection with generating, transforming, converting or conveying electricity. However, if we receive less
        notice than this from a third party who is not under our control and has the right to access your property (such
        as a network company) then we will give you as much notice as practicable after we have received notice.</p>

      <h4>We will access the property appropriately:</h4>

      <p>If under this clause 7, we, our employees or agents access your property we will:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>take reasonable steps to minimise direct impacts on the property or inconvenience to you, and to comply with
          your reasonable requirements;</li>
        <li>ensure our employees and agents carry identification showing they are our authorised representatives and
          show
          you this on your request and identify themselves before entering that property;</li>
        <li>ensure our employees and agents act courteously and professionally at all times.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>What might happen if you don’t provide us the required access:</h4>

      <p>If we are acting in accordance with this clause 7, and you do not provide clear and safe access, we or the
        network company may need to temporarily disconnect your electricity supply.</p>

      <h3>Your responsibilities in relation to the electricity supply equipment on the property</h3>

      <h4>Things you need to do:</h4>

      <p>You must take reasonable steps to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>make sure nothing on your property interferes with or damages the distribution network;</li>
        <li>ensure the safety, security and maintenance of any electricity lines and equipment used on each property;
        </li>
        <li>ensure the safety, security and maintenance of any electricity lines and equipment past a distribution
          connection point to any dwelling or premises on a property;</li>
        <li>keep trees, vegetation and other obstacles away from meters and the electricity lines - this includes
          anything
          overhanging from neighbouring premises;</li>
        <li>make sure there is sufficient secure space at each property for metering equipment and other equipment we or
          the network company think is necessary to supply electricity to you;</li>
        <li>make sure that other people at a property comply with your obligations under this clause 8.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Tell us if there is damage:</h4>

      <p>You must notify us or your network company as soon as you become aware of any damage to, or fault with, meters
        or
        equipment.</p>

      <h4>Things you cannot do:</h4>

      <p>You must not:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>connect or disconnect a property to a distribution network, or interconnect two or more network connection
          points (these are the points at which a property connects to an isolating device on the distribution network);
        </li>
        <li>interfere with or work on a network company’s lines or equipment;</li>
        <li>take a supply of electricity from anywhere along the electricity lines between a distribution connection
          point
          and the meter;</li>
        <li>interfere with any meter or other equipment used to supply you electricity;</li>
        <li>generate electricity or inject it into a distribution network;</li>
        <li>use a distribution network to send or receive any signal or communication.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>More things you cannot do:</h4>

      <p>Meters, meter reading equipment, and other equipment that we, a network or metering company own, does not
        belong
        to you, but to the party responsible for supplying it. You must never:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>interfere with or remove a meter or meter reading equipment;</li>
        <li>interfere with any other equipment supplied by us or a network company;</li>
        <li>allow any mortgage, security interest or other charge to be created over a meter or other equipment that we,
          a
          network or metering company own, or otherwise interfere with ownership of any of them.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Keep trees trimmed:</h4>

      <p>You have obligations under the Electricity (Hazards from Trees) Regulations 2003 to, for example, keep trees free from power lines. Information about your obligations to maintain trees and other vegetation so electricity supply is not affected is set out on our website in our <abbr title="frequently asked questions">FAQ</abbr> section.</p>

      <h4>What happens if you do not meet your responsibilities:</h4>

      <p>If you do not meet your obligations in clauses 5, 7 and 8 we will inform you and give you time to rectify or to
        take dispute resolution proceedings:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>and if we (or third parties such as network companies or metering equipment providers) incur costs or
          charges,
          for example we (or third parties) have to do work that you should have done, we may charge you for that work;
        </li>
        <li>
          and if the failure is material or persistent and is clearly established, we may:
          <ol>
            <li>disconnect your electricity supply and refuse to reconnect your property;</li>
            <li>require you to switch to another retailer;</li>
            <li>inform the Police where we consider that the matter is serious enough.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Your obligations to network companies:</h4>

      <p>You must:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>comply with the network company’s network connection standards that apply to your property; these include
          safety and technical requirements. You can obtain a copy of each of these from the relevant network company.
          If
          you are unsure who your network company is, you can contact us to find out;</li>
        <li>follow any instructions given to you by a network company to make sure its electricity lines or equipment on
          your premises is safe;</li>
        <li>accept that a network company may interrupt your electricity supply if we are in default under our contract
          with the network company.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Your obligations in relation to load control devices installed at your property:</h4>

      <p>Load control devices allow us or your network company to switch off power at your meter in certain
        circumstances,
        such as when there’s a fault or demand is very high. This usually applies to hot water, or nightstore
        heating.<br>
        If a property has load control devices and you have agreed to a pricing plan that allows your electricity to be
        load controlled, you must allow us or your network company to control their operation, in some cases this may
        mean
        interrupting your supply without notice. Details of such pricing plans are outlined on our website.</p>

      <h4>8.9 We will pass on compensation we receive from network companies:</h4>

      <p>If we receive compensation from a network company or another third party for losses that result from an
        interruption to electricity supply, we will pass that on to you.</p>

      <h4>Claims for network company issues:</h4>

      <p>If you suffer a loss or damage because of something the network company does or does not do, you can only claim
        from us what we can recover from the network company, and that is applicable to you.</p>

      <h4>Network company liability is limited:</h4>

      <p>Each network company has excluded or limited its liability to you and to us. Unless the agreement we have with
        a
        network company provides otherwise, all liability any network company may have to you is excluded, as much as
        the
        law allows.</p>

      <h4>Your financial responsibility to network companies:</h4>

      <p>If you damage network company equipment or distribution, you may be liable for any damage you cause. If a
        network
        company suffers direct loss or damage which is caused or contributed to by your fraud, dishonesty, or wilful
        misconduct, you will be liable to make good that loss or damage.</p>

      <h4>Other provisions that network companies can enforce:</h4>

      <p>The provisions of clauses 3, 7, 8 and 9 that allow a network company to interrupt electricity supply, oblige
        you
        to give access to and look after network company equipment and lines and cooperate with each network company are
        intended for the benefit of and are enforceable against you by each network company under the Contract and
        Commercial Law Act 2017.</p>

      <h3>Ending or suspending our obligation to supply electricity to you</h3>

      <h4>Payment to us:</h4>

      <p>You have to pay for all electricity supplied, and for all fees charged to you, to each property until:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>the date you or we notify the other that you’ve ended the supply of electricity under these terms and
          conditions; or </li>
        <li>the later of the following dates:
          <ol>
            <li>when you move out of that property; or</li>
            <li>when you notify us you have moved out of that property.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>If you want to switch to another electricity supplier:</h4>

      <p>You may switch to another electricity supplier or end the supply of electricity in accordance with these terms
        and conditions at any time. In these events you will need to pay for all electricity supplied to your
        property(ies) and any other charges you owe us. It is up to you to arrange for your new supplier to supply
        electricity to your property.</p>

      <h4>Tell us if you are moving out of a property:</h4>

      <p>If you are moving out of your property, you must tell us 2 business days in advance so we can prepare a final
        invoice(s) for that property.</p>

      <h4>Tell us if you want electricity supply suspended:</h4>

      <p>If you want the electricity supply to a property suspended temporarily or permanently, you must tell us 10
        business days in advance. You may incur a charge for disconnection or reconnection when you ask us to do either
        of
        these things, or if we have had to disconnect.</p>

      <h4>Our obligations in relation to your switch to another electricity supplier:</h4>

      <p>The timeframes in clauses 9.3 and 9.4 are within accepted industry standards and relevant laws. If you switch
        to
        another retailer, we will switch you to that other retailer in accordance with industry standard and relevant
        laws
        and facilitate the switch.</p>

      <h4>When we will disconnect the electricity supply:</h4>

      <p>If you no longer need electricity supplied to a property at all, we will stop your electricity supply as soon
        as
        reasonably practical after you notify us of that (while making sure disconnection occurs safely).</p>

      <h4>Reasons electricity supply might be disconnected:</h4>

      <p>Either we or a network company may disconnect your electricity supply to any property if you:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>do not pay us for amounts invoiced under these terms and conditions. However we will not disconnect you if
          the
          amount unpaid is the subject of a genuine dispute resolution process, or is an estimated amount;</li>
        <li>do not meet your obligations in relation to any material term or condition or you persistently do not meet
          your obligations in relation to any other term or condition. We will not disconnect you if the matter in
          question is subject to the dispute resolution process. Before disconnecting you, we will give you the chance
          to
          meet your obligations (if it is possible to do so) and we will tell you how to do that;</li>
        <li>move into a property that we supply electricity to and you do not tell us.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Notice of disconnection:</h4>

      <p>In accordance with our processes (including our debt collection process) we will tell you at least 7 business
        days before we disconnect the supply of electricity to a property, by sending a notice to the physical address
        we
        hold for you. We will also give you a final warning at least 24 hours before we intend to disconnect supply of
        electricity to that property. Each notice will include information about the timeframe within which
        disconnection
        will take place and what you need to do to stop disconnection. We will not disconnect you on a Friday or on the
        day before a public holiday and we will only disconnect on business days.</p>

      <h4>If electricity is needed for critical medical equipment:</h4>

      <p>If you tell us that you, or someone at the property to which we supply electricity, is dependent on that
        electricity supply for critical medical support and provide evidence when we ask, we will not disconnect
        electricity supply to that property for non-payment. We may however disconnect the property if there is an
        immediate safety risk.</p>

      <h4>Disconnections for safety and electricity supply reasons:</h4>

      <p>We or a network company may disconnect or disrupt your electricity supply without notice for safety reasons,
        where there has been an occurrence or circumstances that may adversely affect the proper working of the
        distribution network or the transmission system, or where there is an emergency.</p>

      <h4>Reconnection after you meet requirements:</h4>

      <p>If we disconnect you (including because you have not paid us) and you satisfy our requirements for
        reconnection,
        we will restore your electricity supply as soon as is reasonably practicable.</p>

      <h4>What happens if we default:</h4>

      <p>If we commit a relevant event of default as defined under the Electricity Industry Participation Code 2010:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          the Electricity Authority can require us to provide information about you and can:
          <ol>
            <li>transfer that information and all or any part of our rights and responsibilities under these terms and
              conditions to another electricity retailer (new retailer); and</li>
            <li>amend these terms and conditions to be consistent with, or more favourable than, the standard contract
              that the new retailer would normally have offered you immediately before we committed the event of
              default;
              and</li>
            <li>amend these terms and conditions to include a minimum term, so that you must stay supplied by the new
              retailer for that term unless you pay a cancellation fee.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>should we already have a legal arrangement in place with another electricity retailer (new retailer), we may
          perform the tasks outlined in 9.12.a in order to expedite the transfer process to this new retailer and ensure
          the continued supply of electricity to your property.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>How much you and we might be responsible for under these terms and conditions</h3>

      <h4>If we cause damage:</h4>

        any
        single event or series of closely related events. In the event we rely on this clause, your rights under clause
