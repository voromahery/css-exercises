# CSS exercise 34: Transitions

Transitions offer us the simplest form of animation in CSS.

The word *transition* means to 'change from one state to another'. In CSS, these transitions occur per element, per property.

1. The first state is the initial state, or how the element was to begin with.
1. The second state, or target state, is what the element will become.

Transitions take care of all the intermediate stages between those two states.

OK, so let's hunker down and learn more about transitions!

1. The `transition` property is a 'shorthand property'. What other properties are included in this shorthand property?
1. What is the difference between a timing function, delay, and duration?
1. What CSS properties are *animatable* using transitions?
1. Can we select more than one property to transition at a time? If so, how?
1. How can we set or define the desired transition state, using CSS?
1. Do we need transitions? What makes them useful?
1. At what point can transitions become a problem?
1. Transitions don't work reliably with the `auto` keyword being one of the end states. Why is that?
1. How can we stagger transitions? i.e. make a number of child elements all start at different times?
