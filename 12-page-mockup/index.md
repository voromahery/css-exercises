# CSS Exercise 12: Weekend mockup project

Remember this mockup `design/blog_design.png`?

![](design/blog_design.png)

Well, now let's try implement the CSS for it!

Take the HTML you wrote, and use it as the base for this exercise's HTML. Put it in `homepage.html`.

Next, make sure the following CSS file is linked: `css/index.css`.

This CSS file includes `@import` declarations, that pull in additional CSS files. Feel free to add your own CSS to this list.

Now, working within the correct CSS file for the job, start coding up the mockup.

**Notes:**

- You'll find all the necessary background images in the `images` folder.
- Don't worry about layout just yet. Everything can work in a single-column. If you have some time at the end, see if you can fix the layout too.
- Try to get the spacing and dimensions of each element right, assuming that the footer text is `1rem`.
- Use the colour picker in MS Paint to find out the `background-color` of the Older Posts 'button'.

Good luck!
