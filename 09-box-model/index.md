# CSS exercise 09: The Box Model

In the CSS standards specification, there's a guideline Browsers have to follow so that they can render boxes properly.

## What is a Box?

Glad you asked. Every visible HTML element is a box.

## Understanding the Box Model

To understand the Box Model better, we're going to have to learn the model itself, and the associated properties and keywords.

1. Write a short essay on what the Box Model is.
1. Draw a diagram of the Box Model
1. Research and describe each of the following keywords:
  - `content-box`
  - `padding-box`
  - `border-box`
1. Research and describe each of the following properties, understand their values:
  - `border` (and its longhand properties)
  - `margin` (and its longhand properties)
  - `padding` (and its longhand properties)
  - `display`
  - `box-sizing`
1. See if you can answer these questions:
  - What happens when two differently sized margins of two different boxes collide?
  - What is the formula for working out an element's visual width? How is this different when using `box-sizing: border-box;` on the element?
  - What is the difference between `display` values `inline`, `inline-block`, and `block`?
