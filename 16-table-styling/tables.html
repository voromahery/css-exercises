        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>The name <dfn>pangolin</dfn> comes from the Malay word <i>pengguling</i>, meaning <q>one who rolls up</q>. However, the modern name in Standard Malay is <i>tenggiling</i>; whereas in Indonesian it is <i>trenggiling</i>; and in the Philippine languages it is <i>goling</i>, <i>tanggiling</i>, or <i>balintong</i> (with the same meaning).</p>

        <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
        <p>The order Pholidota in the past was considered to be the sister taxon to Xenarthra (anteaters, sloths, and armadillos), but recent genetic evidence indicates their closest living relatives are the Carnivora with which they form the clade Ferae.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The physical appearance of a pangolin is marked by large hardened overlapping plate-like scales, which are soft on newborn pangolins, but harden as the animal matures.They are made of keratin, the same material from which human fingernails and tetrapod claws are made, and are structurally and compositionally very different from the scales of reptiles. The pangolin's scaled body is comparable in appearance to a pine cone. It can curl up into a ball when threatened, with its overlapping scales acting as armor, while it protects its face by tucking it under its tail. The scales are sharp, providing extra defense from predators.</p>
